						<h2>

						<h2>
							Hobbies
						</h2>
						<p>
							My hobbies involve playing basketball, games, watching movies and hanging out with friends. I've been playing basketball my
							whole life and always try to play whenever I can. Fun fact: I probably haven't went more than a month without playing basketball
							for about a decade. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I also like to play games such as chess, poker and mobile/video games - I am a big fan of Supercell games. I also really enjoy watching movies; my favorite movie
							is Interstellar. I'm also a big fan of the Mission Impossible and James Bond series. I also like to relax and hang out with friends!

						<h2>
							Interests
						</h2>
						<p>
							Some of my interests include watching the NBA, shoe collecting, and the stock market.
						</p>
						<p>
							I enjoy following the NBA and especially tracking player and team statistics. I love playing fantasy basketball with friends
							and often spend a lot of time musing over numbers. I also recently got into shoes, although I only started collecting so I don't
							have too many at the moment. I've also been really big into stocks and investing since the pandemic started. Starting stocks has
							been a great thing to pick up as it has improved my financial literacy and I feel better equipped for my future.
