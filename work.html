						<h2>
							Interactive NBA Dashboard
						</h2>
						<p>
							This dashboard was created as a group for a class final project. I helped create the main plot, having the circle size dependent on points scored.
							I also adjusted the opacity to better show all the overlapped points.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to the main component, I created the second interactive visualization in the bottom middle.
							I wanted to compare the offensive efficiency of players to not only the league average, but also to the average of their position.
						</p>
						<p>
							Skills Used: Ajax, PHP, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

							FIE 2020 Sweden Conference Research Paper
						</h2>
						<p>
							This paper was created for a research conference in 2020.
						</p>
						<p>
							I co-authored this paper with my research mentor and professor Dr. Vetria Byrd.

						<h2>
							Xtern Data Science Application
						</h2>
						<p>
							This Python notebook was created as an application to a technical interview for Xtern. It uses data about various restaurants and the notebook analyzes the data and finds trends that may be useful to both restaurant owners and customers.
						</p>
						<p>
							Note: the notebook passed the Xtern technical round. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Disclaimer: the data used in the project was for an application, and thus is not real.

						<h2>
							Lafayette Census Data Analysis
						</h2>
						<p>
							This notebook was made for my research with the Byrd Vis Lab. It takes Lafayette Census data and draws parallels and contrasts  versus other areas in Indiana.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are 2 interactive charts with dropdowns that cannot be displayed on Github. Feel free to contact me if you would like to see them or more information about this research.

						<h2>
							SPY Analysis
						</h2>
						<p>
							This Python notebook analyzes the past 5 years of SPY data. It attempts to find trends and patterns in SPY daily changes. It attempts to find the optimal range of a SPY daily change that would be most often followed by a positive, green day.
						</p>
						<p>
							This was a project I created on my own, inspired by my passion for investing. I hope to do more stock market or similar projects in the future.

						<h2>
							NBA MVP Shot Chart Visualization
						</h2>
						<p>
							I created this interactive chart for a data visualization class. It shows the shot chart (makes and misses) of the top 2 MVP candidates from 2018-2019. There is a toggle button to view the differences between the 2 players.
						</p>
						<p>
							Note: This chart was created with d3.js, a data visualization JavaScript library.

						<h2>
							Lafayette Census Data Analysis Poster
						</h2>
						<p>
							This was a poster designed while conducting undergraduate research for Dr. Byrd.
						</p>
						<p>
							I used census data from Lafayette to find and analyze trends that identified inequity in different areas of Lafayette.
